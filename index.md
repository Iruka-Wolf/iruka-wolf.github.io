# About Me

I'm an Ivy Tech student studying Computer Science with a passion for video games and music! I make original compositions and video game music covers. 80's and 2000's Rock is my main inspiration for music, so expect a plethora of power chords and even more powerful drums!

I work with [DistroKid](https://distrokid.com/) as my distributor and Record Label, and I couldn't recommend them more! If you are a student or educator looking to work with a music distributor yourself, use [my referral link](https://distrokid.com/student/7579233) for a 50% discount!
